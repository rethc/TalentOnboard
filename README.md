# Software Developer - Onboarding Project

Welcome to my react web application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on an SQL database. 

## This app is built on:

* ASP.NET Core and **C#** for cross-platform server-side code.
* React for client-side code.
* Semantic UI React for layout and styling.
* Azure SQL Database for the backend database.
* react-axios libraries for AJAX calls.
