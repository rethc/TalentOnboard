Welcome to my react web application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on an SQL database. 

## Live Demo:

## This app is built on:
* **ASP.NET Core** and **C#** for cross-platform server-side code.
* **React.js** for client-side code.
* Semantic UI React for layout and styling.
* Azure SQL Database for the backend database.
* react-axios libraries for AJAX calls.
